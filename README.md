# MOOCs – Massive Open Online Courses  
## Hands-On Assignments, Code Snippets, and Course Projects

------------------------------------------------------------

## [ OVERVIEW ]

This repository is a **personal archive of practical work completed across several MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platforms**. 
It contains:
- Code assignments
- DIY labs and exercises
- Test drafts and partial solutions
- Failed experiments and reworks ("fail & try again")
- Snippets and notes collected while completing technical courses

The goal: to **document real, hands-on learning outcomes** while navigating online self-paced technical education.

------------------------------------------------------------
